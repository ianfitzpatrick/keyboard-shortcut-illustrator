I couldn't find a simple way to do screenshots and animated gifs of shortcut
combinations, so I adapated an adaption of the css-keyboard project.

- [Dustin Cartwright](http://www.noxxten.com) - Primary CSS and HTML.
- [Dustin Hoffman](http://www.breefield.com/) - Javascript to animate keypresses.
- [Cameron Little](http://camlittle.com) - Javascript to type by clicking the keys on the onscreen keyboard. Small bit of CSS to make a light on the caps lock key.
- [Ian Fitzpatrick](http://ianfitzpatrick.com) - Styling changes to make keypresses much more visible. Prevent scrolling on arrow keys/space bar. Added options to supress animation of left/right shift and option keys, which browsers can't differentiate.
